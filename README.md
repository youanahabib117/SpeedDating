This dataset was gathered from individuals participating in 21 speed dating events from 2002-2004. During these events, the attendees would have 4 minutes with each participant of the opposite sex. After each of the 4 minute rounds, the participants would be asked to rate the other participant on the following attributes: attractiveness, sincerity, intelligence, fun, ambition, and shared interests. In addition, this dataset includes answers from a questionnaire that the participants had to fill out at different times which include demographics, dating habits, preferences/opinions and lifestyle. Ultimately, these participants decide if they would like to see their date again or not.
